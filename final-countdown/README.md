# Final Countdown!!!

## Challenge:
Create a single-page application in **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)** that functions as an art gallery using the [Hardvard Museums API](https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api). Use the API to present items from the Harvard Museums collection. You can choose what kinds of items you want to show in your gallery. Be creative with how you present the collections - think about the experience of the viewer with what they want to view and learn.
